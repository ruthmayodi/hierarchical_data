# hierarchical_data

This assignment shows a type of database and different ways of working with it. It showcases a simple Django server that uses MPTT models from django-mptt to create a Dropbox-esque web interface where you can create "folders" and "files" in an arbitrary structure and then display that structure.We will not be uploading actual files but this give an example of model instances and using them to represent real data. It is one of the many ways data can be organized. 

To run this repository you will require Django, MTTP and Python.
